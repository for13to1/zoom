    Hi VAX/VMS and future PBMplus users!!!

        This version of Jef Poskanzer's PBMplus package is ready-made to
    support the DEC VAX/VMS C environment.  In an attempt to make it run
    like the Unix environment, the  programs  have been modified to look
    like they use the "piping" and  "redirection"  features  of Unix and
    MSDOS.  In this way, the documentation  and  other people's comments
    (i.e.,  USENET  alt.graphics.pixutils discussions, etc.) will be the
    same for all platforms.

        This  VMS  implementation  borrows  heavily  from  the  previous
    PBMplus/VMS release  by  Rick Dyson for 10dec91 which in turn builds
    on the work  Terry  Poot (tp@mccall.com) did for the 05feb91 general
    release of PBMplus.   Many thanks and credits go his direction.  The
    "piping/redirection"    is    attributed    to    Mark     Pizzolato
    (mark@infopiz.uucp).  The creation of the  shareable  library is due
    to work done by Dave Jones (JONESD@kcgl1.eng.ohio-state.edu).

        Well, since you are reading this, I  guess  you have the PBMplus
    kit and have broken it out into it's  respective  directories.    At
    this  point you just have to start the build  operation.    In  this
    release  of the PBMplus package the process is much easier  than  in
    the past.  There is no patching of the source code necessary  and so
    there is no  extra  "patch-build kit".  This contains everything you
    need to build the PBMplus package.
    
        There is only one step to the preparation process and that is to
    copy  all the files from the [.VMS] sub-directory up one level  into
    the  root  [PBMplus]  directory.

"MAKEFILE.MMS"
-------------
        There are  two  methods  of building the executables.  The first
    (and prefered) method  uses DECs "makefile" utility, MMS, which uses
    the "MAKEFILE.MMS" files.   If  you  don't  have  MMS,  skip  to the
    section labeled "MAKE_PBMPLUS.COM" below.  If you are still with me,
    just  type  "MMS  /Description  =  Makefile.MMS"    and  follow  the
    directions outlined on the screen.  Your most probable sequence will
    be the something like the following:

$ MMS /Description = Makefile.MMS ALL
$ MMS /Description = Makefile.MMS INSTALL   ! creates & loads [.Exe]
$ MMS /Description = Makefile.MMS HELP      ! make PBMPLUS.HLB
$ MMS /Description = Makefile.MMS MANUAL    ! will need LaTeX and tr2TeX...
$ MMS /Description = Makefile.MMS INSTALLMANUAL ! creates & loads [.TeX]
$ MMS /Description = Makefile.MMS CLEAN     ! clean up all recoverable files

        The  available  choices  will  be  displayed  if you  don't  say
    anything, i.e.

            $ MMS /Description = Makefile.MMS

"MAKE_PBMPLUS.COM"
------------------
        The  other  method  of  building the package is to  execute  the
    "MAKE_PBMPLUS.COM" command  procedure.    This was mostly created by
    the "MMS BUILD_PROC"  command.    It  is not as flexible as MMS, but
    should get the job done.  Look  through the procedure and edit it as
    you see fit.  It builds and installs  just  about  everything, so it
    might be in your best interest to look through  it and use your veto
    powers to comment out the unneeded (or unavailable) parts.   Be sure
    to look and check what you have before executing the procedure.

"SETUP.COM"
-----------
        I  have  provided  two  setup  files  with  this distribution to
    facilitate  the  day-to-day use of PBMplus.  All you need to  do  is
    execute  the  SETUP.COM  command  procedure and it will make all the
    logical name  and  foreign  symbol  definitions.    You  should look
    through SETUP.COM and  read  the  comments  about the rooted logical
    names used.  After  all  that, look through the TeX documentation or
    the on-line help files to get an idea of how to start using PBMplus.
    
        NOTE:    An  error  in  MMS will occur if you  have  used
        SETUP.COM before  using  MMS.  A logical name conflict or
        something.  Either  logout  and login to clear things out
        or  Deassign PBMplus_Root and  PBMplus_Dir  before  using
        MMS.
    
Manifest
--------
        The following files are included  with this VMS port of PBMplus.
    The bare essential ones needed to complete the build are marked with
    an astreisk (*):

        [.VMS]MAKEFILE.MMS     -- VMS MMS description file (i.e., "makefile")
                                  for all of PBMplus
       *[.VMS]MAKE_PBMPLUS.COM -- VMS command procedure produced by MMS to build
                                  the PBMplus package for users without MMS
       *[.VMS]MAKE_PBMPLUSSHR.COM -- VMS command procedure to build Shareable
                                  link library of the four main PBMplus object
                                  libraries; LIBPBM, LIBPGM, LIBPPM, & LIBPNM
        [.VMS]SETUP.COM        -- An initialization/definition command proc for
                                  "everyday use" of PBMplus once it's built
        [.VMS]ADD_LIST.COM     -- Generic command procedure to add another
                                  library to any VMS librarian list, (i.e.,
                                  Hlp$Library_nn or Lnk$Library_nn)
        [.VMS]PBMPLUS.HLP      -- VMS Help library file for all of PBMplus
        [.PBM]MAKEFILE.MMS     -- VMS MMS description file for PBM routines
        [.PGM]MAKEFILE.MMS     -- VMS MMS description file for PGM routines
        [.PPM]MAKEFILE.MMS     -- VMS MMS description file for PPM routines
        [.PNM]MAKEFILE.MMS     -- VMS MMS description file for PNM routines
        [.LIBTIFF]MAKEFILE.MMS -- VMS MMS description file for LIBTIFF routines

        When it's all over and done, the  PBMplus  directory tree should
    resemble  the following:

    PBMPLUS  ---+ EXE                           <-- the binaries
                |
                + LIBTIFF                       <-- TIFF library
                |
                + PBM                           <-- Portable BitMaps
                |
                + PGM                           <-- Portable Grayscale Maps
                |
                + PNM                           <-- Portable aNy Maps
                |
                + PPM                           <-- Portable Picture Maps
                |
                + VMS                           <-- VMS specific files
