.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input.
Produces a PCL file suitable for printing on an HP PaintJet XL printer as
output.
.PP
The generated file is not suitable for printing on a normal PrintJet printer.
The
.B \-nopack
option generates a file which does not use the normal TIFF 4.0 compression
method. This file might be printable on a normal PaintJet printer (not an XL).
.PP
The
.B \-gamma
option sets the gamma correction for the image. The useful range for the
PaintJet XL is approximately 0.6 to 1.5.
.PP
The rendering algorithm used for images can be altered with the
.B -dither,
.B -cluster,
and
.B -diffuse
options. These options select ordered dithering, clustered ordered dithering,
or error diffusion respectively.
The
.B \-dark
option can be used to enhance images with a dark background when they are
reduced in size.
The
.B \-presentation
option turns on presentation mode, in which two passes are made over the paper
to increase ink density. This should be used only for images where quality is
critical.

.PP
The image can be resized by setting the 
.B \-xsize
and 
.B \-ysize
options. The parameter to either of these options is interpreted as the
number of dots to set the width or height to, but an optional dimension of
`\fBpt\fR' (points), `\fBdp\fR' (decipoints), `\fBin\fR' (inches), or
`\fBcm\fR' (centimetres) may be appended.
If only one dimension is specified, the other will be scaled appropriately.

The options
.B \-width
and
.B \-height
are synonyms of
.B \-xsize
and
.B \-ysize.

The
.B \-xscale
and
.B \-yscale
options can alternatively be used to scale the image by a simple factor.

.PP
The image can be shifted on the page by using the
.B \-xshift
and
.B \-yshift
options. These move the image the specified dimensions right and down.
