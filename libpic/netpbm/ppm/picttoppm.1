.IX picttoppm
.SH NAME
picttoppm - convert a Macintosh PICT file into a portable pixmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B picttoppm
.RB [ -verbose ]
.RB [ -fullres ]
.RB [ -noheader ]
.RB [ -quickdraw ]
.RB [ -fontdir file ]
.RI [ pictfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a PICT file (version 1 or 2) and outputs a portable pixmap.
.IX PICT
.IX Macintosh
Useful as the first step in converting a scanned image to something
that can be displayed on Unix.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-fontdir \fIfile\fP
Make the list of BDF fonts in ``file'' available for use by
.IR picttoppm
when drawing text.
See below for the format of the fontdir file.
.TP
.B \-fullres
Force any images in the PICT file to be output with at least their
full resolution.  A PICT file may indicate that a contained
image is to be scaled down before output.  This option forces images
to retain their sizes and prevent information loss.
Use of this option disables all PICT operations except images.
.TP
.B \-noheader
Do not skip the 512 byte header that is present on all PICT files.
This is useful when you have PICT data that was not stored in
the data fork of a PICT file.
.TP
.B \-quickdraw
Execute only pure quickdraw operations.  In particular, turn off
the interpretation of special PostScript printer operations.
.TP
.B \-verbose
Turns on verbose mode which prints a 
a whole bunch of information that only
.I picttoppm
hackers really care about.
.SH BUGS
The PICT file format is a general drawing format.
.I picttoppm
does not support all the drawing commands, but it does have full
support for any image commands and reasonable support for line,
rectangle, polgon and text drawing.
It is useful for converting scanned images and some drawing
conversion.
.PP
Memory is used very liberally with at least 6 bytes needed for every
pixel.  Large bitmap PICT files will likely run your computer out
of memory.
.SH "FONT DIR FILE FORMAT"
.I picttoppm
has a built in default font and your local installer probably provided
adequate extra fonts.  You can point
.I picttoppm
at more fonts which you specify in a font directory file.  Each line
in the file is either a comment line which must begin with ``#'' or
font information.  The font information consists of 4 whitespace
spearated fields.  The first is the font number, the second is the
font size in pixels, the third is the font style and the fourth
is the name of a BDF file containing the font.  The BDF format is
defined by the X window system and is not described here.
.PP
The font number indicates the type face.  Here is a list of known font
numbers and their faces.
.PP
.nf
0	Chicago
1	application font
2	New York
3	Geneva
4	Monaco
5	Venice
6	London
7	Athens
8	San Franciso
9	Toronto
11	Cairo
12	Los Angeles
20	Times Roman
21	Helvetica
22	Courier
23	Symbol
24	Taliesin

The font style indicates a variation on the font.  Multiple variations
may apply to a font and the font style is the sum of the variation numbers
which are:
.PP
.nf
1	Boldface
2	Italic
4	Underlined
8	Outlined
16	Shadow
32	Condensed
64	Extended

Obviously the font defintions are strongly related to the Macintosh.
More font numbers and information about fonts can be found in Macintosh
documentation.
