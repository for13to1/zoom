.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -interlace
Tells the program to produce an interlaced GIF file.
.TP
.B -sort
Produces a GIF file with a sorted color map.
.TP
.B -map 
.I mapfile

Uses the colors found in the
.I mapfile
to create the colormap in the GIF file, instead of the colors from
.I ppmfile.
The
.I mapfile
can be any
.I ppm
file; all that matters is the colors in it. If the colors in
.I ppmfile
do not match those in
.I mapfile
, they are matched to a "best match". A (much) better result can be obtained by
using the following filter in advance:

.I ppmquant
-floyd -map
.I mapfile
.TP
.B \-transparent \fIcolor\fP
Mark the given color as transparent in the GIF file.  The color is specified
as in
.IR ppmmake (1).
Note that this option outputs a GIF89a format file which might not be
understood by your software.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
