.SH NAME
pbmto4425 \- Display PBM images on an AT&T 4425 terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpbmto4425 \fP[\fIpbmfile\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIPbmto4425\fP displays PBM format images on an AT&T 4425 ASCII terminal
using that terminal's mosaic graphics character set.  The program
should also work with other VT100-like terminals with mosaic
graphics
character sets such as the C. Itoh CIT-101, but it has not
yet been tested on terminals other than the 4425.
.PP
\fIPbmto4425\fP puts the terminal into 132 column mode to
achieve the maximum resolution of the terminal.  In this
mode the terminal has a resolution of 264 columns by 69
rows.  The pixels have an aspect ratio of 1:2.6, therefore
an image should be processed before being displayed in a
manner such as this:
