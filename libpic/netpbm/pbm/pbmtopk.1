.SH NAME
pbmtopk - convert a portable bitmap into a packed (PK) format font
.SH SYNOPSIS
pbmtopk pkfile[.pk] tfmfile[.tfm] resolution [-s designsize] [-p num param...]
[-C codingscheme] [-F family] [-f optfile] [-c num]
[-W width] [-H height] [-D depth]
[-I ital] [-h horiz] [-v vert] [-x xoff] [-y yoff] [pbmfile]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads portable bitmaps as input, and produces a packed (PK) font file and a
TFM (TeX font metric) file as output. The resolution parameter indicates the
resolution of the font, in dots per inch. If the filename "-" is used for any
of the filenames, the standard input stream (or standard output where
appropriate) will be used.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-s designsize"
Sets the design size of the font, in TeX's points (72.27pt to the inch). The
default design size is 1. The TFM parameters are given as multiples of the
design size.
.IP "-p num param..."
Sets the first num font parameters for the font. The first seven parameters
are the slant,
interword spacing, interword space stretchability, interword space
shrinkability, x-height, quad width, and post-sentence extra space of the
font. Math and symbol fonts may have more parameters; see The TeXbook for a
list of these. Reasonable default values are chosen for parameters which are
not specified.
.IP "-C codingscheme"
Sets the coding scheme comment in the TFM file.
.IP "-F family"
Sets the font family comment in the TFM file.
.IP "-f optfile"
Reads the file optfile, which should contain a lines of the form:
.sp
.nf
.na
   filename xoff yoff horiz vert width height depth ital
.fi
.ad
.sp
The pbm files specified by the filename parameters are inserted consecutively
in the font with the specified attributes. If any of the attributes are
omitted, or replaced with "*", a default value will be calculated from the
size of the bitmap. The settings of the -W, -H, -D, -I, -h, -v, -x, and -y
options do not affected characters created in this way.
The character number can be changed by including a line starting with "=",
followed by the new number.
Lines beginning with
"%" or "#" are ignored.
.IP "-c num"
Sets the character number of the next bitmap encountered to num.
.IP "-W width"
Sets the TFM width of the next character to width (in design size multiples).
.IP "-H height"
Sets the TFM height of the next character to height (in design size multiples).
.IP "-D depth"
Sets the TFM depth of the next character to depth (in design size multiples).
.IP "-I ital"
Sets the italic correction of the next character to
ital (in design size multiples).
.IP "-h horiz"
Sets the horizontal escapement of the next character to horiz (in pixels).
.IP "-v vert"
Sets the vertical escapement of the next character to vert (in pixels).
.IP "-x xoff"
Sets the horizontal offset of the next character to xoff (in pixels).
.IP "-y yoff"
Sets the vertical offset of the next character to yoff (in pixels, from the
top row).
