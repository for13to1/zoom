.SH NAME
pbmtolps - convert portable bitmap to PostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
pbmtolps [ -dpi n ] [ pbmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable bitmap as input, and outputs PostScript.
The output Postscript uses lines instead of the image operator to
generate a (device dependent) picture which will be imaged
much faster.
.PP
The Postscript path length is constrained to be less that 1000
points so that no limits are overrun on the Apple Laserwriter
and (presumably) no other printers.
