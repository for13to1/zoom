.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pbmtext
.RB [ \-font
.IR fontfile ]
.RB [ \-builtin
.IR fontname ]
.RI [ text ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Takes the specified text, either a single line from the command
line or multiple lines from standard input, and renders it
into a bitmap.
.IX text
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
By default, pbmtext uses a built-in font called bdf
(about a 10 point Times-Roman font).
You can use a fixed width font by specifying \-builtin fixed.
.PP
You can also specify your own font with the
.B -font
flag.
The
.I fontfile
is either a BDF file from the X window system or a PBM file.
.PP
If the
.I fontfile
is a PBM file, it is created in a very specific way.
In your window system of choice, display the following text
in the desired (fixed-width) font:
.nf

    M ",/^_[`jpqy| M

    /  !"#$%&'()*+ /
    < ,-./01234567 <
    > 89:;<=>?@ABC >
    @ DEFGHIJKLMNO @
    _ PQRSTUVWXYZ[ _
    { \\]^_`abcdefg {
    } hijklmnopqrs }
    ~ tuvwxyz{|}~  ~

    M ",/^_[`jpqy| M

.fi
Do a screen grab or window dump of that text, using for instance
.IR xwd ,
.IR xgrabsc ,
or
.IR screendump .
Convert the result into a pbm file.
If necessary, use
.I pnmcut
to remove everything except the text.
Finally, run it through
.I pnmcrop
.IX pnmcrop
to make sure the edges are right up against the text.
.I pbmtext
can figure out the sizes and spacings from that.
