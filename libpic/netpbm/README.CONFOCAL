Additions to the PbmPlus package.

This enhanced version of the PbmPlus package supports reading of files
from three different confocal scanners, the Molecular Dynamics (Sarastro),
the Biorad and the Zeiss. The package can convert from any of these images
to the pbm format, from which it can produce gif, tiff, x11 dumps, mac paint,
etc. In order to convert from a confocal image format, use the following
commands:

* Molecular Dynamics (Sarastro) and Leica:

  rawtopgm -tb [file] > outfile.pgm

  For more information, give the command "man rawtopgm"

* Biorad

  bioradtopgm [-image#] [file] > outfile.pgm

  For more information, give the command "man bioradtopgm"

* Zeiss (old format)

  zeisstopnm [-pgm|-ppm] [file] > outfile.pnm

  For more information, give the command "man zeisstopnm"

* Zeiss (new format)

  tifftopnm [file] > outfile.pnm

I have tested the programs on one Zeiss file (old format) and on one
Biorad file. There probably remain some bugs to be fixed. Please report
them to me when you encounter them (email:oliver@fysik4.kth.se).

I have compiled and installed the PbmPlus package on the following machines:
* Silicon graphics (Personal Iris) with gcc 2.4.0
* Sun386i with gcc 2.4.0

BUGS

The libtiff part can be tricky to compile. On an sgi I managed to use
gcc. On a sun386i, I had to compile tif_dir.c, tif_error.c and tif_warning.c
with cc instead. The rest of the files could be compiled with gcc.

On the sun386i, the pgmtexture.c file would not compile with gcc -O.
It worked fine without the optimization flag. Probably a bug in gcc.

COPYRIGHTS

All the software in this package, whether by me or by a contributer,
has a copyright similar to this one:

    copyright notice and this permission notice appear in supporting
    documentation.  This software is provided "as is" without express or
    implied warranty.

Many people get confused by this legalese, especially the part about
"without fee".  Does this mean you can't charge for any product that
uses PBMPLUS?  No.  All it means is that you don't have to pay me.
You can do what you want with this software.  Build it into your
package, steal code from it, whatever.  Just be sure to let people
know where it came from.
