.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a PostScript file as input.
.IX PostScript
Produces portable anymap files as output.
This program is just a useful shell script that runs 
.I GhostScript
to render a PostScript into one or more pnm files.
.I Pstopnm 
will create as many files as the number of pages in
the Postscript document.  If the input file is named
.IR psfile.ps ,
the name of the files will be
.IR psfile001.ppm , 
.IR psfile002.ppm , 
etc.
.PP
The program maps a rectangular portion of the PostScript document into
an image file according to the command line options.  The selected area will
always be centered in the output file, and may have borders around it.
The image area to be extracted from the PostScript file and rendered
into a portable anymap is defined by four numbers, the lower left
corner  and the upper right corner x and y coordinates.
These coordinates are usually specified by the BoundingBox comment
in the PostScript file header, but they can be overridden by the user by 
specifying one or more of the following flags:
.BR \-llx ,
.BR \-lly ,
.BR \-urx ,
and
.BR \-ury .
The presence and thickness of a border to be left around the image
area is controlled by the use of the flags
.B \-xborder
and
.BR \-yborder .
If BoundingBox parameters are not found, and image area coordinates
are not specified on the command line, default values are used.
Unless both output file width and height are specified via the 
.B \-xsize 
and
.B \-ysize 
flags, the program will map the document into the output image
by preserving its aspect ratio.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B \-forceplain
.RS
forces the output file to be a plain (i.e. not "raw") portable anymap.
.RE
.PP
.B \-help
.RS
prints the command syntax.
.RE
.PP
.B \-llx
.I bx
.RS
selects 
.I bx
as the lower left corner x coordinate (in inches).
.RE
.PP
.B \-lly
.I by
.RS
selects 
.I by
as the lower left corner y coordinate (in inches).
.RE
.PP
.B \-landscape
.RS
renders the image in landscape mode.
.RE
.PP
.B \-portrait
.RS
renders the image in portrait mode.
.RE
.PP
.B \-nocrop
.RS
does not crop the output image dimensions to match the PostScript
image area dimensions.
.RE
.PP
.B \-pbm \-pgm \-ppm
.RS 
selects the format of the output file.  By default, all files are
rendered as portable pixmaps (ppm format).
.RE
.PP
.B \-urx
.I tx
.RS
selects 
.I tx
as the upper right corner x coordinate (in inches).
.RE
.PP
.B \-ury
.I ty
.RS
selects 
.I ty
as the upper right corner y coordinate (in inches).
.RE
.PP
.B \-verbose
.RS
prints processing information to stdout.
.RE
.PP
.B \-xborder
.I frac
.RS
specifies that the border width along the Y axis should be 
.I frac
times the document width as specified by the bounding box comment in
the PostScript file header.  The default value is 0.1.
.RE
.PP
.B \-xmax
.I xs
.RS
specifies that the maximum output image width should have a size less
or equal to
.IR xs 
pixels (default: 612).   
.RE
.PP
.B \-xsize
.I xs
.RS
specifies that the output image width must be exactly
.I xs
pixels.
.RE
.PP
.B \-yborder
.I frac
.RS
specifies that the border width along the X axis should be 
.I frac
times the document width as specified by the bounding box comment in
the PostScript file header.  The default value is 0.1.
.RE
.PP
.B \-ymax
.I ys
.RS
specifies that the maximum output image height should have a size less
or equal to
.IR ys 
pixels (default: 792).   
.RE
.PP
.B \-ysize
.I ys
.RS
specifies that the output image height must be exactly
.I ys
pixels.
.RE
.SH BUGS
The program will produce incorrect results with PostScript files that
initialize the current transformation matrix.  In these cases, page
translation and rotation will not have any effect.  To render these
files, probably the best bet is to use the following flags:
.PP
\ \ \ pstopnm -xborder 0 -yborder 0 -portrait -nocrop file.ps
.PP
Additional flags may be needed if the document is supposed to be
rendered on a medium different from letter-size paper.
